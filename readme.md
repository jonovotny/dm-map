# Fantasy Campaign map (Forgotten Realms)

An approach to visualize continent and local maps of a D&D campaign wit a google maps-like interface. 

To start a development server (available at http://localhost:5173):

    cd dm-map
    npm install
    npm start

To generate a build ready for production:

    npm run build

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your server.  You can also run `npm run serve` to serve the results of the `dist` directory for preview.
